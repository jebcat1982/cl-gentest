cl-gentest is a generative testing library for Common Lisp.  You describe
properties about your code that should hold, and the library will generate
random data to test it with.

It's similar(ish) to Haskell's [QuickCheck][] or Clojure's [test.check][], but
doesn't try to be a straight port of either.
